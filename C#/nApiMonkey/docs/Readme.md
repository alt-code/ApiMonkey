Running instructions: 
1. Clone the project
2. Go to folder C#/ApiMonkey.
3. Open nApiMonkey.sln in Visual Studio.
4. Open file Program.cs and modify values of following variables:
			string project_name = ""; #Name of the project eg. "Microsoft.Bot.Builder"; Ususally same as name of main .sln file
            string project_path = @""; #Path to the location where you want to clone original project eg. @"G:\samples_proj";
            string sandbox_path = @""; #Path to sandbox folders eg. @"G:\nuget_sandbox_new\BotBuilder_new";
            string oldRootSol = @""; #Path to the folder in original project where mail solution file is located. eg. @"G:\samples_proj\BotBuilder\CSharp" folder has Microsoft.Bot.Builder.sln file
            string testLocation = @""; #relative path to the folder where test dlls are located eg. @"Tests\Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Tests\bin\Debug\Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Tests.dll";

5. Set script paths- Currently hardcoded to the values inside nApiMonkey\scripts folder
   eg.      string git_script = @"G:\new_demo\ApiMonkey\C#\nApiMonkey\nApiMonkey\scripts\gitcmd.sh";
            string build_script = @"G:\new_demo\ApiMonkey\C#\nApiMonkey\nApiMonkey\scripts\build.bat";
            string copy_script = @"G:\new_demo\ApiMonkey\C#\nApiMonkey\nApiMonkey\scripts\script.bat";

6. Also the individual build report and test reports can be found inside each sandbox folder. Following are the files generated by this tool:
Build Reports:
- msbuild1.log : contains output of msbuild run
- BuildWarnings.log : lists all warning generated during msbuild run
- BuildErrors.log : lists all errors generated during msbuild run

Test run report:
- TestResults.trx : contains test run result of unit tests written using visual studio.

Currently the tool only supports tests written by visual studio. Other testing frameworks can be added such as xunit, nunit etc.
